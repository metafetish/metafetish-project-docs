# Metafetish Project Docs

This repository contains documents that will need to be copied to new
Metafetish project repos when they are created. This includes:

- A Code of Conduct, with addendum on how to deal with conversations
  of a sexual nature in relation to project development
- A Contributors document, which lays out our management strategies
  and commonly used tools.
- A stub license file, as almost all Metafetish projects are covered
  under the BSD 3-Clause license.
